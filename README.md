# QuizLingo 
A Kotlin-based app designed for language learners to practice vocabulary through quizzes. Users are presented with images and are prompted to input the corresponding word in their chosen language. The app leverages the <strong>Unsplash Image API</strong> to provide relevant visuals and integrates the <strong>Google ML Kit Translator AP</strong>I for accurate validation of user input against correct translations. It focuses on reinforcing language comprehension through contextual learning.
